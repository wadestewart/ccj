        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p>
            Currently, nearly one in every 100 American adults is behind bars and once released from prison more than four in ten return within three years. This failing system costs federal, state and local governments approximately $85 billion, yet does not deliver adequate public safety results for taxpayers and victims. In addition to the enormous budgetary costs, our current criminal justice system places tremendous human costs on society.
        </p>

        <p>
            In response, the American Legislative Exchange Council began its work in Criminal Justice, aimed to advance proven criminal justice reforms based on over two decades of data-driven research and practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Members of the Criminal Justice Task Force advance solutions that refocus criminal justice resources on dangerous offenders and put the right programs in place to hold non-violent offenders accountable while providing them with the resources they need to become contributing members of society. The Criminal Justice Task Force focuses on three key areas: Corrections and Reentry, Pretrial Release and Overcriminalization.
